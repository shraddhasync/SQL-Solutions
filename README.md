# üìä SQL for E-Commerce Sales Analysis

This repository contains SQL queries I developed for my **Sales Data Analyzer** project during my BTech studies. These queries helped extract business insights from an e-commerce dataset.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Aggregation** (SUM, COUNT, GROUP BY)
- **Table Joins** (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
- **Business Intelligence** (Revenue trends, product performance)
- **Excel Integration** (Exported results for PivotTable dashboards)

SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity) as total_units_sold
FROM products
JOIN order_details ON products.id = order_details.product_id
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY total_units_sold DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Monthly Revenue Growth
SELECT 
  DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') as month,
  SUM(quantity * price) as monthly_revenue
FROM orders
